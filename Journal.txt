Progress made on getting a single article to render. Created a function in home called getPost that grabs the id of the article from the read me button in <blog/>.
it then sets state post to the article object itself. Tried getting it to render but pathing for the switch is not working. may need to change article back to a regular component instead of a class component.
see line 46 in article preview for note.

*mistake made on line 85 with the path, wrote 'Blog/:id' instead of '/Blog/:id'

Article component now renders

running into an issue where using the removeTags function passed through from home to article is returning undefined when use on this.props.post.content and this.props.post.excerpt 
but does not return the same error when used in article preview component used on the same object.

I think its a problem with and my lack of understanding of, async. The way that its operating now is that im pressing read more which then grabs the id mounts the individual post object
and adds it to state which then is passed onto article and renders the page. the function itself doesnt seem to be working because it believe this.props.post.content is undefined.
use this.props.post.content alone returns exactly what I want however.
