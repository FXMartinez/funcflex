Progress made on getting a single article to render. Created a function in home called getPost that grabs the id of the article from the read me button in <blog/>.
it then sets state post to the article object itself. Tried getting it to render but pathing for the switch is not working. may need to change article back to a regular component instead of a class component.
see line 46 in article preview for note.

*mistake made on line 85 with the path, wrote 'Blog/:id' instead of '/Blog/:id'

Article component now renders

running into an issue where using the removeTags function passed through from home to article is returning undefined when use on this.props.post.content and this.props.post.excerpt 
but does not return the same error when used in article preview component used on the same object.

I think its a problem with and my lack of understanding of, async. The way that its operating now is that im pressing read more which then grabs the id mounts the individual post object
and adds it to state which then is passed onto article and renders the page. the function itself doesnt seem to be working because it believe this.props.post.content is undefined.
use this.props.post.content alone returns exactly what I want however.

changed article back to a component, it doesnt seem necessary to have it as a class component. Dont think I can do the same with article preview as the conditional doesnt seem to work
with it being a functional component and not a class component.

after console logging each component it seems that it definitely is an async issue and something i need to wrap my head around, thought it seems like a lot of work to simply remove tags
from a string to display content.

after changing article to a class component, it seems like my method of getting the information for an article is flawed I should go through the array of posts instead of using a get to
retrieve a single post.

changing the get post to pull from the state posts instead of making another call to the api didnt change the outcome, the function removetags still returns undefined when used on the
post.content

Temporarily solved the problem for article by adding this.props.post.content to state via componentDidMount on line 13 of article.js component. Should be a better solution to this I should
figure out.

*EUREKA after creating a new component called article content, it solved the issue of props.post.content returning undefined when used inside of the remove tags function. However I found a
solution that made the function itself obsolete and instead eseentially 'imports' and renders the html from the wordpress api keeping the styling and the image tags.
example: <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: html.content.here}} />

had an issue that held me up with deploying to firebase. in the file firebase.json in the public key had a value other than build. changing the value to build allowed it to be deployed and
visible on both the firebase serve and the hosting site funcflex.com.

Decided to create an actual navbar component instead of using the placeholder buttons I initially had
Will probably change the style and size, maybe functionality as well not sure yet. getting a weird habit from my local server where changes are not being updated. not even sure how or when
this started to happen.

changed some css to change the orientation of elements but lost the background color and cant seem to get it back. finished changing the nav bar from a regular div to a react component with
styling. 

*IDEA - change the styling of the entire page to mimic that of a windows CLI prompt, add a logo that starts out as Func(Flex) where flex changes to the blog name or maybe the part of the 
pages aswell making it seem like a function with arguments. Possible add a drop down console interfact like in doom or jedi outcast games (unreal engine console?). may add functionality to
type in specific pages like commands and navigate like a prompt.

realized I have to change the blog component and everything associated with it to the coding portion or figure out how to get the same code working for the other blogs like the gaming and
the fitness one as well. I could just be really lazy and redundant but thats never good. 
changed a bunch of styling around the site, working on implementing putting either the button or just the word in the sites 'logo function call arg'.
Tried a switch case, failed miserably, really need to work on fundamentals.

wrote out a switch case i'll try tomorrow, see if it pans out the way I think it will.
I should be able to change the url for the blog pathing without needing to change the actual components name or anything else and just use it as is for the gaming and fitness blogs.
